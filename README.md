# Calculus-1-in-Python
This repo contains basics of Calculus1 which are as follows:

**1.** Idea of Limits & Slope Derrivatives (1st order & 2nd order).<br>
**2.** Idea of Area Antiderivative (Area Under the 2D function's graph curve).<br>
**3.** Concept of Definite Area Antiderivative (for a specific closed interval).<br>
**4.** Idea of Improper Area Antiderivative. An improper Area Antiderivative is a Definite Area Antiderivative over an interval which is not closed, that is, open or half open, and whose limits of integration are the end points of that interval.<br>
**5.** Concept of Series & Sequences.<br>
